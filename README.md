## ðŸ“– About
Hello reader, hope you're doing well. Did this as an internship task, turned out to be a decent project :D This is a great "todo-list" project for anyone looking to start with some new framework or brush up on their frontend skills. 
To dive deeper into this project, instructions to run the app/server, about the architecture of the project, head over to the readme's files in the `app` and `server` directories (links below). Here's some basic info if you're just skimming through -

- **Frontend:** Flutter, Dart, Riverpod (State Management) | [readme](app/)
- **Backend:** Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, Azure Container Instance | [readme](server/)
